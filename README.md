Trying to make a game with SDL2 using c++

Repository added just to get help fixing an error that might be hidden in the code.
This might become an actual game some day in the future if everything works as intended.
Otherwise this repository might get deleted.

This project contains SDL2 and SDL2_image dlls for the windows binary. SDL2 was not coded by myself and I did not modify the source code.
